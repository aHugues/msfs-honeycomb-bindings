### Throttle axis

| Axis  | Function  | Reverse detent    |
| ---   | ---       | ---               |
| 1     | Spoilers  | N/A               |
| 2     | N/A       | N/A               |
| 3     | Engine 1  | Engine 1 reverse  |
| 4     | Engine 2  | Engine 2 reverse  |
| 5     | N/A       | N/A               |
| 6     | Flaps     | N/A               |

To arm the ground spoilers, slightly move the speedbrake lever (roughly to the "arm" marking).

To use reverse thrust: pull the reverse lever, and descend the levers to the reverse position. To disable reverse thrust,
push the reverse lever, which will return the thrust to idle.

Detents are roughly configured for the spoilers, but not the thrust levers or flaps. For this, use the Fenix configuration tool.
